        We ran the tool on news.ycombinator.com and although the site had a layout
        table, it’s linked image does not contain alternative text. Moreover, the
        text is very small and several links contain no text.

      <h2>Question 4</h2>
      <p>
        As a native app is designed and programmed for a specific device, it means
        that it is totally compatible with the device’s hardware and features;
        whereas, a web app can access limited amount of the device’s features.
        A web app can update itself without user intervention.

      <h2>Question 5</h2>
      <p>
        The W3C internationalization working group tackes the problem iof internationalization
        from a few different agles: A big one is the contribution to the unicode project
        which is working on creating a common character system which aims to make
        all characters from every language, dead or alive, displayable on every computer.
        Another one is the implementation of IDN, an effort to translate non ASCII domain names
        into ASCII ones which can be looked up by DNS. This makes people which are not familiar
        with the latin alphabet able to use domains in their own language, but it
        needs a client side application and is not implemented in the DNS system itself.
        The IETF also works on making text of all languages displayable in html and css,
        which means inlcuding support for different text orientations (ltr, rtl, top down)
        and displaying characters which change depending on the surrounding characters.

      <h2>Question 6</h2>
      <p>
        Using the command tracert in the command prompt. Interestingly, I found
        out that both share the exact same IP addresses. This is because the domain stays the
        same, while the subdomain changes. A web server can deal with this in many
        different ways, maybe it uses completely different applications for requests
        with different subdomains or it could just ignore them. While here this is an example
        of using different subdomains for very different topics in the same organisations
        web page, on for example github users can have their organisation as a subdomain.

      <h2>Question 7</h2>
      <p>
        There are a variety of reasons to switch to IPv6. The primary reason is
        that we are simply running out of IP addresses; however, with IPv6 we
        will have 2128 addresses as opposed to 232, Moreover, there will be no
        more fragmentation.

        While, GET is used to request a specific resource; whereas, POST is used
