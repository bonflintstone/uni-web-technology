        The difference in the approach lays in two parts: Selecting the element
        and adding the action listener. The syntax for both is way shorter in
        jquery, but in that it is also lest volatile, abstracting away more of
        the details of how it works. While in the vanilla js version we
        explicitely state that we select by id, in jquery we use the # as a
        symbol for this (this would also be possible in pure js with the
        querySelector function. And instead of explicitely stating that we add an
        action listener for a certain action ('click'), we just give a function
        to what should happen on a click in jquery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I dont think one is neccessarily better than the other, because while the
        vanilla js solution is longer it also yields more understanding about
        what is happening, and it is not too bad to read. The true difference
        herein for me lies in the importing of a huge 3rd party library for and
        easy task, which has load time, security and other implications. It also
        means that the name space for functions and variables is more flooded,
        which when including many 3rd party libraries can lead to many hard to
        debug problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general the tendency of the industry is to go away from jquery, as
        javascript has evolved to a point where it is easy enough to use that we
        dont need it anymore. I personally consider that a good thing.

      <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</p>
      <p>
        Asynchronus here means that the script will send a request to the server, and
        continue it's execution without waiting for the reply. The reply will be
        processed in a seperate thread whenever it returns

        Host objects are supplied by the browser where the
        script is executed to the JavaScript. Two often used host
        objects are window and document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In java and some other programming languages there is no need for any
        host objects, as there are mainly used either for interacting with the
        DOM (which is unique to js) or to scope global variables, and scoping and
        namespaces work way differently in java (and agains different inother
        languages).

        Events are ‘things’ that happen to an html document and the event can be fired
        by eg. a user interactions as clicking a button and will be processed using an
        event listener. In other words, events and event listeners define which
        javascript functions need to be called when.

        Autocomplete aims to match user requests by using google’s enormous library
        “places”. Autocomplete objects are bound to the map to only show results
        within the visible boundaries of the map. Then an event listener in the
        autocomplete object is used to listen for changes in selection, in order to
        match those changes in requests.

        The like button works by sideloading a script from facebook which will
        load the content neccessary to create the like button in a dedicated div,
        and the open graph protocol works by including different mate tags in the
        head of the html with content describing the website and a unique id
        which is used by facebook to differentiate between the websites.
