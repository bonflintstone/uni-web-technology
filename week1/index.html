      <h3>Question 2</h3>
      <p>The web is the part of the internet that web browsers and web services make use of, defined by http/ html/ ajax etc.</p>
      <p>The Internet includes the web, but also many other technologies like ftp, ssh, email etc.</p>

      <h3>Question 3</h3>
      Time Berners-Lee mainly created the following 3 technologies for the web:
      <ul>
        <li>HTTP</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>URI</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Question 4</h3>
      <p>
        The html generated by the document already contains the whole basic html structure and doctype, as well as some metadata hinting at where it comes from and when it was created. It also contains some basic style in the head and has inline style for the generated p element which wraps the text.
        <br />
        Striking here is that the distance measure used here is cm (centimeters), instead of the usually used px or em, but elsewise the file does not yield anything special.

      <h3>Question 8</h3>
      <h4>Benefits of IFrames</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>IFrames circumvent the cross domain origin policy</li>
        <li>Uselful to have mutliple different sources for the page</li>
        <li>Security for using 3rd party content, as the iframe is basically sandboxed (javascript/ styling etc can only affect things inside the iframe)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Downsides of IFrames</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Hard to style right</li>
        <li>The content in iframes is not good for search engines to index</li>
        <li>Making it easy to change the page without messing with the url</li>

      <h3>Question 10</h3>
      <p>
        Either it gets emphasised in another way, or it just stays the same. My assumption is that it does not further emphazise it and the text just stays italics, as this is the normal behavior for doubled styling. Lets try it out:
      </p>
      <p style='font-style: italic;'>Normal italics <em>also emphazised</em></p>
      <p>So it looks exactly the same. No surprise there.</p>

      <h3>Question 11</h3>
      <p>
        I will compare Chrome with Firefox, as those are the two browsers most familiar to me.
        <br />
        I also will only look at the current versions of the browsers and not dive into the history of them.

      <div>
        <h4>Firefox</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>High configurability</li>
          <li>Many features for advanced users (tab groups/ reading mode)</li>
          <li>Slightly slower, but better in resources</li>
          <li>Open source</li>
          <li>Non commercialiced, better for privacy</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Chrome</h4>
        <ul>

      <h3>Question 2</h3>
      <p>
        We ran the tool on news.ycombinator.com and although the site had a layout
        table, it’s linked image does not contain alternative text. Moreover, the
        text is very small and several links contain no text.

        Foreground color: #84FFFF, background color: 083333 The brightness
        difference is above 125 and the color difference is above 500, which
        means they are compliant, meaning that they provide enough contrast
        for someone who is color deficient or when viewed as black or white
        Foreground color: #84FFFF background color: #D63333 The brightness
        difference is below 125 and the color difference is below 500, which
        means they are not compliant, meaning that they don’t provide enough
        contrast for someone who is color deficient or when viewed as black or
        white Foreground color: #000004 background color: #44CEFB The brightness
        difference is above 125 and the color difference is above 500, which

      <h3>Question 4</h3>
      <p>
        As a native app is designed and programmed for a specific device, it means
        that it is totally compatible with the device’s hardware and features;
        whereas, a web app can access limited amount of the device’s features.
        A web app can update itself without user intervention.

      <h3>Question 5</h3>
      <p>
        The W3C internationalization working group tackes the problem iof internationalization
        from a few different agles: A big one is the contribution to the unicode project
        which is working on creating a common character system which aims to make
        all characters from every language, dead or alive, displayable on every computer.
        Another one is the implementation of IDN, an effort to translate non ASCII domain names
        into ASCII ones which can be looked up by DNS. This makes people which are not familiar
        with the latin alphabet able to use domains in their own language, but it
        needs a client side application and is not implemented in the DNS system itself.
        The IETF also works on making text of all languages displayable in html and css,
        which means inlcuding support for different text orientations (ltr, rtl, top down)
        and displaying characters which change depending on the surrounding characters.

      <h3>Question 6</h3>
      <p>
        Using the command tracert in the command prompt. Interestingly, I found
        out that both share the exact same IP addresses. This is because the domain stays the
        same, while the subdomain changes. A web server can deal with this in many
        different ways, maybe it uses completely different applications for requests
        with different subdomains or it could just ignore them. While here this is an example
        of using different subdomains for very different topics in the same organisations
        web page, on for example github users can have their organisation as a subdomain.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Question 7</h3>
      <p>
        There are a variety of reasons to switch to IPv6. The primary reason is
        that we are simply running out of IP addresses; however, with IPv6 we
        will have 2128 addresses as opposed to 232, Moreover, there will be no
        more fragmentation.

      <h3>Question 9</h3>
      <p>
        While, GET is used to request a specific resource; whereas, POST is used
        to send data to the web server.

      <h3>Question 3</h3>
      <a id='prevent-default-query' href="https://google.nl">Google</a>
      <p>
        The difference in the approach lays in two parts: Selecting the element
        and adding the action listener. The syntax for both are way shorter in
        jquery, but in that it is also less volatile, abstracting way more of
        the details of how it works. While in the vanilla js version we
        explicitly state that we select by id, in jquery we use the # as a
        symbol for this (this would also be possible in pure js with the
        querySelector function. And instead of explicitly stating that we add an
        action listener for a certain action ('click'), we just give a function
        to what should happen on a click in jquery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think one is neccessarily better than the other, because while the
        vanilla js solution is longer it also yields more understanding about
        what is happening, and it is not too bad to read. The true difference
        herein for me lies in the importing of a huge 3rd party library for and
        easy task, which has load time, security and other implications. It also
        means that the name space for functions and variables is more flooded,
        which when including many 3rd party libraries can lead to many hard to
        debug problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general the tendency of the industry is to go away from jquery, as
        javascript has evolved to a point where it is easy enough to use that we
        don't need jquery anymore. I personally consider this a good thing.

      <h3>Question 5</h3>
      <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</p>
      <p>
        Asynchronus here means that the script will send a request to the server, and
        continue it's execution without waiting for the reply. The reply will be
        processed in a seperate thread whenever it returns

      <h3>Question 6</h3>
      <p>
        Host objects are supplied by the browser where the
        script is executed to the JavaScript. Two often used host
        objects are window and document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In java and some other programming languages there is no need for any
        host objects, as there are mainly used either for interacting with the
        DOM (which is unique to js) or to scope global variables, and scoping and
        namespaces work way differently in java (and agains different inother
        languages).

        by eg. a user interactions as clicking a button and will be processed using an
        event listener. In other words, events and event listeners define which
        javascript functions need to be called when.

      <h3>Question 9</h3>
      <p>
        Autocomplete aims to match user requests by using google’s enormous library
        “places”. Autocomplete objects are bound to the map to only show results
        within the visible boundaries of the map. Then an event listener in the
        autocomplete object is used to listen for changes in selection, in order to
        match those changes in requests.

      <p>
        The like button works by sideloading a script from facebook which will
        load the content neccessary to create the like button in a dedicated div,
        and the open graph protocol works by including different mate tags in the
        head of the html with content describing the website and a unique id
        which is used by facebook to differentiate between the websites.

      <h3>Question 1a</h3>
      <p>
        This tokenizer on first sight does a decent job, but diving deeper in the
        output and actually looking at the code reveals that this is one of the most
        basic ways of tokenizing: The string gets lowercased and then split on
        the regular expression '\W', which stands for all non word characters
        (basically everything except letters and digits).
        <br>
        This gives us loads of room for improvement:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>  
          Abbreviations with apostrophes can get confused, the "s" in "it's" is the
          same as in "Jesus's". To avoid this we would need some basic language parsing.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not differentiate between capitalized words and non capitalized words.
          This means names which are also words get confused. Eg. "mr Beans" and
          "cooked beans" are not really differentiated. Of course, to implement it
          differently we would need to also look at the beginning of sentences and then
          it would be hard to decide if the token should be capitalized or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          This is a low level parsing, so words which belong together get tokenized
          as different tokens instead of one. So for example "Free university Amsterdam"
          is three tokens, instead of one which might be semantically more correct.
        </li>
        <li>
          One could also implement some word-rooting to recognize different forms 
          and declinations of words, as well as aliases. But this is strictly
          speaking not part part of tokenizing
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Question 1b</h3>
      <p>
        It would make sense to include all of the words in the stop words list as
        they all have relatively low discriminatory power and thereby, disregarding 
        these terms, we can focus our search engine(information retrieval) on important
        keywords that would more closely bring up pages that are of interest. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Question 1c</h3>
      <p>
        We think that the frequency follows Zipf’s law, which basically means that
        the higher the frequency of the terms is, the lower the rank of the word is.
        Moreover, following Zipf’s law also implies that the most frequent word will
        appear about twice as often as the second most frequent word, and three
        times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Question 1d</h3>
      <p>
        We also see that Heaps law applies here, which implies that by scanning
        the book we will hit upon the most common words rather quickly like “the
        for example, but will increasingly slower continue to find more infrequent
        new words.

      <h3>Question 2a</h3>
      <p>
        One can assess the quality of a TF-based search by counting the number of
        relevant pages and non-relevant pages returned. This ties into precision
        which is the amount of relevant pages returned and recall is the fraction
        of relevant pages in the collection that were returned  by the system. Therefore
        the higher the quality of a TF-based search the higher the precision and recall is.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        The only change here is the value associated with the term and chapter, instead
        of just showing the number of occurrences we now have the new calculated
        values, which are in general lower and seem to be logarithmic proportional
        to the term frequency
        <br>
        The three highest ranking words are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Chapter 5:  pigeon: 6.58</li>
        <li>Chapter 6:  footman 6.75</li>
        <li>Chapter 10: dance 6.77</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I don't think one could say they 'describe' the chapter very well, but in
        terms of importance per article they are way better than the TF scores.
      </p>
      <h3>Question 2b</h3>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Question 2c</h3>
      <p>
        TFIDF-based search: Pigeon, footman, dance, dormouse, witness (tfidf)
        <br>
        TF-based search: The, she, to, it, and (TF)
        <br>
        In this case, it is obvious to see that the precision for a TFIDF-based search is
        much higher compared to the TF-based search as the five highest ranking
        words have very low discriminatory power and fit on the stop word list. 
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Question 2d</h3>
      <p>
        I will go through each of my suggestions in the same order in which I made
        them:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Precision would go up (confusion between it's and Jesus's would go away) while
          recall would stay the same.
        </li>
        <li>Same as previous.</li>
        <li>Same as previous.</li>
        <li>Precision would stay the same but recall would go up</li>
