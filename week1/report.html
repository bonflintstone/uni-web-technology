        Our site relies solely on text to portray information and is not
        dependent on non-text content or colors to portray any information. This
        in turn means that our site is quite accessible as the information can
        easily be converted into a medium suited for the the individual user such
        as audio. We do have images on our site for pure-decoration, but no
        functionality, which in turn means that we have not included any text
        alternative. Moreover, each lab is accessible through our navigation
        menu, which allows you to easily access any of the labs no matter where
        you are on the page. Moreover, each individual question is seperated into
        sections with its own appropriate header in an appropriate size, which
        allows the reader to clearly distinguish a relationship between the
        header and the text element.  To conclude, the design of our site is
        relatively simple which makes it more accessible, but at the same time
        providing the required functionality.

        There are two accessibility guidelines that we believe play a very
        important role in making our website accessible. The first one being
        principle 1.4 that states to make it easier for users to see content
        including separating foreground from background. We used the color
        checker on all the different backgrounds and text colors to ensure that
        our site was compliant with a high enough brightness difference, contrast
        difference, and color difference. We only had to change the color of the
        titles for each lab to ensure that we would meet this guideline.
        Moreover, we havenâ€™t implemented any complicated methods for presenting
        our information, which means all of information is presented in a simple
        text format, which means that our site complies with principle 1.3. Our
        site meets this criteria, because the information on our site is in a
        format that can easily be programmatically determined by assistive
        technology, so it can be rendered in the format required by the user.
        These two guidelines ensure that our site can be the most accessible for
        the most amount of people.

        We found that our site complied with most of the guidelines; however,
        there was still room for improvement. The font size of our text was quite
        small, so we included a button that you could toggle to increase the size
        of the entire website, so it would be easier to read. Moreover, we
        changed the color of our title to ensure that our website was compliant
        with the guidelines for color contrast.

            <td>1.1 Non-text-content</td>
            <td>
              Our non-text content consists of 3 images; however, the images
              serve no purpose other than for pure decoration, which means that our
              site does not violate principle 1.1.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              1.3 Adaptable: Create content that can be presented in different
              ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or
              structure.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our site meets this criteria, in the sense that the information
                  on our site is in a format that can easily be programmatically
                  determined by assistive technology, so it can be rendered in
                  the format required by the user
                </li>

              content including separating foreground from background.
            </td>
            <td>
              Using the color contrast checker we found that the contrast between
              the color of the sections and the actual text is high enough to
              ensure visibility of the text. However, we did find that our titles
              for each lab were not compliant with the color contrast checker,
              meaning we had to change the colors to comply with it.

              All functionality such as links and forwarding a POST request can
              be done using the keyboard.

            </td>
            <td>
              Our site partly complies with 2.4 as we have a navigation menu
              located in the header, which allows individuals users to navigate
              through the answers for each lab individually.

              Positive impact on accessibility and usability, because it
              provides different hyperlinks to different contents and limits the
              size of the page to a resonable limit.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              As clearly stated in the assignment (at the very top) you have to
              hand in a single html file called index.html, not two html files
              called lab1.html and lab2.html.

              Was used in an exceptional context, which is not even agains any
              regulations stated in the lectures. The use here was appropiate
              anyways imho.

          <tr>
            <td>
              Nothing really changes in respect to the normal screen style. The
              form remains the same, and so does the style of the page.
            </td>
            <td>
              Which is a good thing, considering that the page works equally well
              on all devices without huge layoutchanges needed. Responsiveness
              means to change things when they need it, not to change them
              because you can.
            </td>

          <tr>

            <td>
              The layout of the CSS files is not really clear, and some
              informative comments would have been good.
            </td>

          <tr>
            <td>
              The use of filenames and file structure was not in order. Again,
              all the lab questions have to be put in one file, the index.html 
              not lab1.html, etc).
